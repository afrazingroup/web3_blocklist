# web3_blocklist
This is a merge of all the web3 blocklists that I can find that are open source. Credit goes to the fine security researchers who are flagging domains everyday to the benefit of the web3 community, I literally just dedup them into one list.

Current Sources:
Metamask (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/master/src/config.json)
Scam Sniffer (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scamsniffer/scam-database/main/blacklist/domains.json)
Phantom Wallet (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phantom-labs/blocklist/master/blocklist.yaml)

Lists are pulled from their sources every two hours. The sources themselves might add or remove items from their respective lists at different frequencies.

When I add domains for actors impersonating Polygon I verify each one is malicious to a reasonable degree, but false positives are possible and will be corrected upon request.

I do not verify domains pulled from trusted sources are malicious myself, I rely on the sources to verify.
