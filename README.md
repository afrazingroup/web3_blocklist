# web3_blocklist
This is a merge of all the web3 blocklists that I can find that are open source. Credit goes to the fine security researchers who are flagging domains everyday to the benefit of the web3 community, I literally just dedup them into one list.

Lists are pulled from their sources every two hours. The sources themselves might add or remove items fron their lists at differenent frequencies.

When I add domains for actors impersonating Polygon I verify each one is malicious to a reasonable degree, but false positives are possible and will be corrected upon request.

I do not verify domains pulled from trusted sources are malicious myself, I rely on the sources to verify.
